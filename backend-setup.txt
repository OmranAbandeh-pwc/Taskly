1- First we need to prepare the package.json file by using this command line : 
    
    - "npm init -y"

2- then you need to install "express" using this command : 

    - "npm i express"

3- install nodemon to make the server update whenever you change anything
in the code using this command line to install : 

    - "npm i -g nodemon"

    - then use this command to make the server run "nodemon server.js"

    - or we can create a new script in the package.json

     for example "dev": "nodemon server.js" then run this command line "npm run dev"


4- then we need to install "dotenv" package to be able to get the variables 
from the .env file to install it use this command line : 

    - "npm i dotenv"
